## 🌨️ FUN FACTS

- I drink more tea than Ice Bear drinks fish smoothies.
- I’d rather walk in cold weather than in the heat.
- I believe dark mode saves more than just battery.
- I can write “Hello, World!” in three languages… with mittens on.
- I believe every bug can be fixed with a calm mind (and maybe a nap).
