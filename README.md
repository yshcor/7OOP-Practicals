## 🌨️ FUN FACTS

- I drink more tea than Ice Bear drinks fish smoothies.
- My favorite IDE theme is always the one with the most white space.
- I once coded an alarm clock that only wakes you if it’s snowing.
- I can write “Hello, World!” in three languages… with mittens on.
- I believe every bug can be fixed with a calm mind (and maybe a nap).
